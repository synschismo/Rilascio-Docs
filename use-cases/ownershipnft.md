# OwnershipNFT

OwnershipNFT transfers the locked NFT back to the OwnershipNFT owner by Burning OwnershipNFT at the end of the lock period. In effect, OwnershipNFT represents ownership of the locked NFT and preserves the value of the locked NFT, allowing the original NFT to be placed on the marketplace or an external collateralized loan to borrow tokens using the OwnershipNFT as collateral. The token can be borrowed using OwnershipNFT as collateral.
