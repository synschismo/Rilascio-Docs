# OwnershipNFT

OwnershipNFT transfers the locked NFT back to the OwnershipNFT owner by Burning the OwnershipNFT at the end of the lock period. In effect, the OwnershipNFT represents ownership of the locked NFT and preserves the value of the locked NFT, allowing the OriginalNFT to be placed on the marketplace or an external collateralized loan to borrow tokens using the OwnershipNFT as collateral. The token can be borrowed using the OwnershipNFT as collateral.
