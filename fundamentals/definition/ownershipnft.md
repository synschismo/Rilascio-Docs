# OwnershipNFT

OwnershipNFT is minted to the lender when the NFT is deposited.

OwnershipNFT transfers the locked NFT to the owner of the OwnershipNFT when it burns at the end of the lock period. It is also possible to manage it with an external service.OwnershipNFT effectively represents ownership of the original NFT, so it can be managed by an outside service.
