# Lender

Lender can be considered Liquidity Providers for NFT in RentaFi.

Lender can become use-value providers by depositing NFTs that are dysfunctioning for various reasons with RentaFi.

NFTs (OwnershipNFT, YieldNFT) which are minted when a lender locks the original NFT can be operated in a separate service. Of course, there is no need to operate it externally by force, and there is absolutely no problem with the policy to continue holding it until the lock period expires. The method of operation is up to the lender.
