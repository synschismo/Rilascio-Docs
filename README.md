### About Rilascio

Rilascio is an no-collateral NFT rental protocol and platform that enables  to operate both "Value from Exchange" (the value generated by their circulation in the market) and "Value from Use" (the value generated by the use of NFTs).Integrating this protocol into the product will maximize the asset efficiency and functionally of NFT that are dysfunctioning in the wallet allowing for on-chain rentals

Currently supported by Rinkby , and we are looking to expand into use cases of rental NFT such as PFP, community memberships, access to services, and game items.

### NFT Issue and Rilascio's Solution

NFTs are beginning to be used not only to prove ownership of assets, but also in a variety of other situations, such as membership in certain communities, in-game assets, and as profile pictures (PFP: picture for proof). On the other hand, the greater the excitement for the community and the game, the higher the price of the NFT and the more valuable it becomes as an asset. The higher the value of the asset, the more the holder increases the endowment effect and the slower the distribution speed.

Rilascio addresses these challenges by splitting the NFT into "Value from Use" and "Value from Exchange". "Value from Use" is the value that is generated through experiences such as game playing and community participation through NFTs. "Value from Exchange", on the other hand, is the value that is generated through the circulation of the item, such as scarcity or transaction value.Rilascio issues three types of NFTs at the time of a rental transaction based on a value split: "OwnershipNFT", "YieldNFT" and "WrappedNFT. This will encourage rentals to NFT holders while maximizing profits and minimizing risk, and will allow temporary newcomers to the community, NFT game experiences, and in-game assets for a variety of users.Furthermore, the platform will not only benefit NFT lenders and borrowers, but will also help boost the community by encouraging new contributions to the community.

### **Mean to Rilascio**

Rilascio, which means "to liberate" in French, aims to free NFTs sleeping in wallets and eliminate all NFT dysfunction.
